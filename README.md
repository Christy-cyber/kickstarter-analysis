# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
---
Data were sorted by categories, subcategories, and launch date by country.  Descriptive statistics focusing on the mean and median for amounts pledged and goal amounts of successful and failed kickstarters in the US were performed.  A box and whisker plot shows the differences in mean and median values between successful and failed musicals in Great Britain.

Theater productions, music, and film & video were shown to do well across all countries, yet theater productions also showed a higher number of failed campaigns.  Additionally, theater productions (plays) were the most successful in Great Britain, even considering the smaller number of 604 starter campaigns for plays.  The average campaign goal for musicals was 4,000 GBP, with the upper quartile approximating 6,000 GBP and the median at 2,000 GBP.  Considering that the average pledge approximated 1,700 GBP, a campaign goal of 4,000 GBP or less would be recommended.

With respect to outcomes based on launch date, it was found that May, especially, and June were the best months to launch a kickstarter campaign.

Descriptive statistics showed that mean goal and mean pledged for both successful and failed US kickstarters were much higher (around the upper quartile) than the median values for both. Median values approximated twice that of the lower quartile.  Standard deviation values were also higher than the mean for goal amounts and amounts pledged for successful and failed US kickstarters, indicating that a few large values, or outliers in both categories, were skewing the distributions for both.

In summary, focus on theater productions, music, and film & video across all countries, and technology should also remain a consideration.  In Great Britain, theater (plays) campaigns do especially well with the target fundraising goal for musicals at 4,000 GBP or less.  Starting a campaign in May or June would produce the best outcomes.  A few outliers are skewing distributions for mean goal and mean pledged amounts for successful and failed campaigns in the US. Instead, focus on median values and note that failed campaigns have higher fundraising goals (median = $5,000.00) than successful ones (median = $3,000).
