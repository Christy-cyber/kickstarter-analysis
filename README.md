# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
---
Data were sorted by categories, subcategories, and launch date by country.  Descriptive statistics focusing on the mean and median for amounts pledged and goal amounts of successful and failed kickstarters in the US were performed.  A box and whisker plot shows the differences in mean and median values between successful and failed musicals in Great Britain.

Theater productions, music, and film & video were shown to do well across all countries, yet theater productions also showed a higher number of failed campaigns.
